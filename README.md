=============
Architecture has always been a part of my life. I grew up in the city of Gdansk in the post-communist country of Poland. Every day I have heard some news about the constantly developing city from my parents. New museums, theaters, houses are built every year. Since a young age I was learning how to observe those changes and how to find inspiration in them. I have always wanted to be a part of this change. Becoming an architect who is able to create structures in a way that can feast oneâ€™s eye and at the same time are functional to the community has been my dream since kindergarten. 
Architecture and various real life compositions are the inspiration as well as the main theme of my art work. Creating art helps me to express my emotions by presenting them and giving them form. At the very beginning of my artistic journey I was only drawing, however with time I became more interested in painting. Experimenting with various tools, brushes and technics helped me to develop my sensibility to colors and shapes. My art represents the world in my own eyes and represent how I feel and see life.
